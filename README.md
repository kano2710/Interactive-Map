# This project is a technical task for the Working Student Geoinformatics position at Forliance GmbH.

## I have uploaded a working project to my server. You can visit at `https://test.dhameliya.com/`

# Description
This project is an Angular-based application that demonstrates advanced features of integrating OpenLayers for map functionalities. It includes multiple exercises showcasing a unique part of map interaction and data integration.

# Tasks:

Exercise 1: Map Initialization

Exercise 2: Clickable Map and Popups

Exercise 3: GeoJSON Integration and Dynamic Styling

Exercise 4: Web Map Service (WMS) Integration

Exercise 5: Unit Testing

# Getting Started

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.5.

## Prerequisites

Angular CLI

Knowledge of TypeScript and Angular framework

## Installation

To clone GitHub repository `git clone https://github.com/kano2710/Working-Student-Geoinformatics.git`

Navigate to the project directory `cd Working-Student-Geoinformatics`

To Install dependencies `npm install`

# Usage

Each exercise is implemented as a separate feature within the Angular application.

## Exercise 1: Map Initialization

Initializes an OpenLayers map.

Sets an Open Street Map as a basic tile layer to the map.

Set the initial view to Eifel Str. 20, Bonn, 53119, Germany, and the default zoom level.

![Ex 1  Map Initialization](https://github.com/kano2710/Working-Student-Geoinformatics/assets/35762039/825fbd93-9c1f-409c-8c71-07ab10d41182)

## Exercise 2: Clickable Map and Popups

Implements click functionality on the map.

Displays popups with location information (Address) using reverse geocoding.

![Ex 2  Clickable Map and Popups](https://github.com/kano2710/Working-Student-Geoinformatics/assets/35762039/7095d143-0515-4c06-bf75-dd3fb2ed24d0)

## Exercise 3: GeoJSON Integration and Dynamic Styling

Loads GeoJSON data asynchronously (using GeoJSON file, which shows the boundary of Germany and India).

Styles features based on properties and allows dynamic updates (via Reload GeoJSON Button).

Added features that allow users to draw geo-fencing or mark the area (Different colors for different draw shapes).

![Ex 3 GeoJSON Integration and Dynamic Styling](https://github.com/kano2710/Working-Student-Geoinformatics/assets/35762039/8f634722-d8ef-410d-890d-d5a1122bb633)

## Exercise 4: Web Map Service (WMS) Integration

Integrates a WMS layer with a climate change theme (Air temperature at a height of 2 meters).

Provides functionality to toggle the WMS layer (via Temperature Layer Button).

![Ex 4 WMS Integration](https://github.com/kano2710/Working-Student-Geoinformatics/assets/35762039/9ecac859-0501-4385-ae39-a8a86e863303)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Exercise 5: Unit Testing

Includes unit tests for map initialization, click events, loading GeoJSON files,  popups, interactions, and WMS layer visibility.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Further help for Angular

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
